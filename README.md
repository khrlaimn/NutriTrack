# NutriTrack
NutriTrack is a mental health mobile app that assists university students in tracking their meal expenses and finding healthy and affordable meal options on campus. This app seeks to address that issue by offering users a range of tools and information to make healthy eating more accessible and affordable. The app allows students to register their meal expenses throughout the day to keep track of how much money they have spent during the day, through a predefined food price provided by vendors inside the UNITEN cafeteria. The food database in the app covers a wide variety of cafeteria meals. Such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, beverages, and fruits. Each food item's nutritional information, such as calories, protein, carbs, and fat, is given. This enables students to make wise decisions about what they eat and how it fits into their goals. Overall, NutriTrack may be a helpful tool for anybody who wants to better understand their food and meal spending in order to make healthier and more cost-effective decisions.
